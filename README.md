```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install pyex tensorflow keras
```
For additional information on installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation), and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) 

If you do not wish to use Anaconda, the following should satisfy the requirements: 
```
pip install pyex pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
